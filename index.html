        <h2 class="mt-10 text-black text-xl">Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Space is fascinating to me, it’s a vast expanse of uncharted territory that humans 
            have only ever scouted with telescopes and unmanned machines. It’s a frontier of infinite potential and 
            I truly do believe that the future of our civilization lies there. Space mining is simply a faucet of that future, 
            and it comes without all of the conflict and strings of mining here on Earth.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Initially the system plan I had encompassed the Earth, sun, and asteroids wherein 
            Earth would construct mining teams using energy from the sun and minerals from asteroids before sending them out 
            on resource retrieval missions for the ultimate goal of developing Earth. However, the sun is a passive energy source 
            in real life and doesn't really need to be modeled in the system. In the end, the system was streamlined into probes, 
            asteroids, and the Earth: a collector, objects to be collected, and the deposit location.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did you translate your diagram into code?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">The diagram was thought in terms of code to begin with, which made the transition 
            relatively straightforward to understand. It helped inform what code elements needed to be implemented, how they 
            needed to be implemented, and the necessary interactions between them.</p>  

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did you deal with the complexity in your system?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">In addition to the Processing References archive, I browsed different forums such as 
            Stackoverflow for troubleshooting errors and looking for solutions. In truth, the system isn’t terribly complicated.</p> 

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did you decide on the interactive elements?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">The interactive elements were chosen based on how I thought a real space mining mission 
            would go: mission control would look for rich asteroids, send a probe for collection, mine, recall it for retrieval, repeat. 
            Translate that to code, and the only real interactable item would be the probe.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> What would be some paths for future development of the project?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">In addition to an aesthetic overhaul with vector drawings or images, I want to expand the scope
             to include a full model of the solar system and add more complexity to mineral collection beyond an arbitrary score metric. 
            Asteroids should contain different kinds of minerals which can be used for construction of human space installations, perhaps.</p>

        <h1 class="mt-5 text-black text-3xl">What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement
             of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design, or to a particular stage in the process.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">This is an issue that I’ve seen crop up in different projects during my time at ArtCenter. 
            There’s a certain value that we place on fidelity and sometimes a complete looking idea took precedence over a more completely 
            planned idea. I think that a prototype need only look as good as it needs to be in order to accurately convey a design thought, 
            but I can’t argue with the fact that sometimes a pretty picture has weight all on it’s own— many of us wouldn’t be designers 
            if we didn’t think this line of work was aesthetically pleasing. But even the most visually competent and well-tested designs 
            could, in fact, be a trap. Some ideas are simply more valid on a fundamental level than others for a given use case and no amount of 
            design patching can change that.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">[Role prototyping] describes the functionality that a user might benefit from, with little attention 
            to how the artifact would look and feel, or how it could be made to actually work.</h2>
       <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Role prototyping sounds like preliminary ideation and feature ideas. It offers the most creative freedom, 
           but I feel there’s sort of a bad rep with designers specifically involving this step. Or perhaps not designers specifically, what I mean 
           to say is that sometimes, out in the wilds of the modern business world, there exist people that spout off ideas without any knowledge 
           of the practical application and limitations of what they’re talking about. It’s important to forget those limitations sometimes in the 
           name of creative solution finding but, in the end, “the ideas guy” isn’t going to get anything accomplished while an engineer might have 
           at least something that a person can use. It makes me wonder if a company under dire financial circumstances would choose to lay off their 
           designers or engineers first. 
       </p>
       <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">At other times it became focused on problems with the user interface, such as the multiple cascading menus, 
           which were hard to control and visually confusing.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">A problem that any prototype designer working for more than a few months can relate to. It’s a difficult issue 
            to avoid— a test prototype needs to at a fidelity high enough to convey a feature accurately so as to not mislead anyone on how it might be 
            implemented but at the same time this leaves it vulnerable to critique about it’s supporting designs (menus, input methods, etc) that aren’t 
            supposed to be the focus. Of course, they could be told to disregard these tertiary filler interfaces and focus on the important bits, but that 
            might lead to confusion in project vision amongst the team or design hiccups down the design cycle. Still, I think it’s important to not get 
            bogged down and teams should allow some problems to remain for at least a little while longer in the project cycle if it means that they can keep 
            up the momentum.
