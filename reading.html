        <h1 class="mt-5 text-black text-3xl font-bold">What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement
             of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design, or to a particular stage in the process.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">This is an issue that I’ve seen crop up in different projects during my time at ArtCenter. 
            There’s a certain value that we place on fidelity and sometimes a complete looking idea took precedence over a more completely 
            planned idea. I think that a prototype need only look as good as it needs to be in order to accurately convey a design thought, 
            but I can’t argue with the fact that sometimes a pretty picture has weight all on it’s own— many of us wouldn’t be designers 
            if we didn’t think this line of work was aesthetically pleasing. But even the most visually competent and well-tested designs 
            could, in fact, be a trap. Some ideas are simply more valid on a fundamental level than others for a given use case and no amount of 
            design patching can change that.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">[Role prototyping] describes the functionality that a user might benefit from, with little attention 
            to how the artifact would look and feel, or how it could be made to actually work.</h2>
       <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Role prototyping sounds like preliminary ideation and feature ideas. It offers the most creative freedom, 
           but I feel there’s sort of a bad rep with designers specifically involving this step. Or perhaps not designers specifically, what I mean 
           to say is that sometimes, out in the wilds of the modern business world, there exist people that spout off ideas without any knowledge 
           of the practical application and limitations of what they’re talking about. It’s important to forget those limitations sometimes in the 
           name of creative solution finding but, in the end, “the ideas guy” isn’t going to get anything accomplished while an engineer might have 
           at least something that a person can use. It makes me wonder if a company under dire financial circumstances would choose to lay off their 
           designers or engineers first. 
       </p>
       <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">At other times it became focused on problems with the user interface, such as the multiple cascading menus, 
           which were hard to control and visually confusing.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">A problem that any prototype designer working for more than a few months can relate to. It’s a difficult issue 
            to avoid— a test prototype needs to at a fidelity high enough to convey a feature accurately so as to not mislead anyone on how it might be 
            implemented but at the same time this leaves it vulnerable to critique about it’s supporting designs (menus, input methods, etc) that aren’t 
            supposed to be the focus. Of course, they could be told to disregard these tertiary filler interfaces and focus on the important bits, but that 
            might lead to confusion in project vision amongst the team or design hiccups down the design cycle. Still, I think it’s important to not get 
            bogged down and teams should allow some problems to remain for at least a little while longer in the project cycle if it means that they can keep 
            up the momentum.

        <h1 class="mt-5 text-black text-3xl font-bold">Programming Design Systems</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">Building design systems code-first is an interesting approach to graphic design, but I'm not quite sure 
            how it would affect creativity. </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">While constraints are one the fundamental parts of fueling creativity, starting straight with code might
            be a bit too restrictive, at least for the ideation phase. While some say that paper drawings is the only way to go, I prefer to start
            most of my ideations in a digital sketch or visual prototyping application. When it comes to websites these days, my favored method is
            actually prototyping in Webflow which is a GUI interface that builds the necessary html, styling, and script code on the fly. However, 
            jumping straight into code is a bit out there. I can understand quickly mocking up a page or element in html, but a whole design system 
            is out of the question for me.
