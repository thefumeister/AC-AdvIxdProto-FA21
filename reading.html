        <h1 class="mt-5 text-black text-3xl font-bold">What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement
             of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design, or to a particular stage in the process.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">This is an issue that I’ve seen crop up in different projects during my time at ArtCenter. 
            There’s a certain value that we place on fidelity and sometimes a complete looking idea took precedence over a more completely 
            planned idea. I think that a prototype need only look as good as it needs to be in order to accurately convey a design thought, 
            but I can’t argue with the fact that sometimes a pretty picture has weight all on it’s own— many of us wouldn’t be designers 
            if we didn’t think this line of work was aesthetically pleasing. But even the most visually competent and well-tested designs 
            could, in fact, be a trap. Some ideas are simply more valid on a fundamental level than others for a given use case and no amount of 
            design patching can change that.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">[Role prototyping] describes the functionality that a user might benefit from, with little attention 
            to how the artifact would look and feel, or how it could be made to actually work.</h2>
       <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Role prototyping sounds like preliminary ideation and feature ideas. It offers the most creative freedom, 
           but I feel there’s sort of a bad rep with designers specifically involving this step. Or perhaps not designers specifically, what I mean 
           to say is that sometimes, out in the wilds of the modern business world, there exist people that spout off ideas without any knowledge 
           of the practical application and limitations of what they’re talking about. It’s important to forget those limitations sometimes in the 
           name of creative solution finding but, in the end, “the ideas guy” isn’t going to get anything accomplished while an engineer might have 
           at least something that a person can use. It makes me wonder if a company under dire financial circumstances would choose to lay off their 
           designers or engineers first. 
       </p>
       <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">At other times it became focused on problems with the user interface, such as the multiple cascading menus, 
           which were hard to control and visually confusing.</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">A problem that any prototype designer working for more than a few months can relate to. It’s a difficult issue 
            to avoid— a test prototype needs to at a fidelity high enough to convey a feature accurately so as to not mislead anyone on how it might be 
            implemented but at the same time this leaves it vulnerable to critique about it’s supporting designs (menus, input methods, etc) that aren’t 
            supposed to be the focus. Of course, they could be told to disregard these tertiary filler interfaces and focus on the important bits, but that 
            might lead to confusion in project vision amongst the team or design hiccups down the design cycle. Still, I think it’s important to not get 
            bogged down and teams should allow some problems to remain for at least a little while longer in the project cycle if it means that they can keep 
            up the momentum.

        <h1 class="mt-5 text-black text-3xl font-bold">Programming Design Systems</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">What happens when we try to redefine the graphic design curriculum using a programming language as the 
            tool for the designer? </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Building design systems code-first is an interesting approach to graphic design, but I'm not quite sure 
            how it would affect creativity. While constraints are one the fundamental parts of fueling creativity, starting straight with code might
            be a bit too restrictive, at least for the ideation phase. While some say that paper drawings is the only way to go, I prefer to start
            most of my ideations in a digital sketch or visual prototyping application. When it comes to websites these days, my favored method is
            actually prototyping in Webflow which is a GUI interface that builds the necessary html, styling, and script code on the fly. However, 
            jumping straight into code is a bit out there. I can understand quickly mocking up a page or element in html, but a whole design system 
            is out of the question for me.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">When designers learn to not only think systematically about the design process, but also to implement 
            those systems in software, they can build things that were not possible before. </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">This is a part of a broader philosophy, I think. In a lot of ways, many professions encourage horizontal
            skill development, and I mean that in a business way. A designer should focus on artistic creativitiy, understand the ins and outs of 
            graphic software, and have a strong asthetic instinct. This way of thinking is outdated and I don't think the current design ecosystem
            allows for that kind of singular dimension skillset. Professionals should have a good vertical understanding of their work: understanding 
            the inner mechanics of their tools and how their work fits into the greater picture. Only by understanding the possibilities and peculiarities
            of their ecosystem can a designer really start building things to their greatest potential.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">... that humans, because we live in a complex world, seek to derive fast, simplified conclusions about what 
            we see. </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">A foundational principle behind a lot of what designers do, although it most often manifests itself as a design
            challenge more than anything. This is also perhaps one of the most irritating characteristics of modern humans. Too often, the most expedient 
            and easily digestable information takes precendence over the most complete and accurate. This is something that designers, journalists, salespeople, 
            and many more take advantage of in order to push things unwittingly against the masses. But beyond that, as a design principle, it is a driving 
            force for good visualization of complex data as well as organization of vast amounts of data.

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">"Amazon Dash Button is a Wi-Fi connected device that reorders your favorite item with the press of
            a button."</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">I had never heard of this product before, despite being an Amazon prime user, but it's probably the most
            eye-rolling thing I've read about in a long, long time. It's a monument to late-stage capitalism, a button whose sole purpose relies on
            the assumption that the user is connected to a massive consumer catalogue and logistics network and consumes a single item at such a scale 
            that they literally need a physical affordance for the sole purpose of ordering more. It's an affordance that falls under the same category 
            as a lightswitch. There might actually be someone out there who presses this button more than they flick on the lights in their home. The 
            effort required to order a favorite item on Amazon is opening an app, find the item on a saved shopping list, then tapping buy because their 
            shipping and payment information has already been saved. It's ridiculous. One of the key goals of IoT is to reduce the effort required to achieve 
            an outcome, but this specific reduction is beyond absurd.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">"It’s not all that expensive to furnish networked
            devices with security elaborate enough to defeat the more obvious exploits—but
            at the low end of the market, where profit margins are reed-thin, any additional
            increment of cost is intolerable."</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">I'm personally opposed to much of the hype surrounding the new internet of things, specifically because
            of this reason. Digital security is difficult, even for the most stringent and well-funded companies. Look at any news source and you
            can find reports of security leaks in nearly every single industry that handles customer information. That's just data, what the 
            internet of things does is increase attack vectors and offer more incentive to breach and manipulate networks secured or otherwise. 
            The author uses the example of a London hotel in which an individual could, from across the planet, control the climate, lights, and 
            entertainment deck of every single guest room. Let's extend this further, what if your car settings could be remotely manipulated by
            someone who managed to get their hands on your credentials? This is why I balk at the idea that we should stick a microchip and internet 
            connection in every last thing.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">"We can understand the recent industry push
            toward the “smart home” as simply the latest version of this: a conscious,
            coherent effort to enlist our intimate spaces as a site of continuous technological
            upgrade, subscription-based services and the perpetual resupply of consumables."</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">In recent years, much of our personal space, and perhaps our very concept of it, has adapted around digital 
            spaces. Various online communities of shared interests or acquaintances can become very intimate social spaces for someone, but it's easy to
            forget that it isn't a 1 to 1 equivalent to a physical chat space. There are thousands of different algorithms runnning in the background and 
            a server somewhere where these interactions are tracked and stored. Again, it's easy to forget this, which is why there are so many stories of 
            people being blindsided by their digital activities from years ago being brought up today. And let's not forget what the typical internet 
            browsing experience is like. Nonstop advertisements and unscrupulous attempts at getting your money layered together that it far exceeds the 
            actual content you're looking for. An arms race between ad-blockers and advertisers only exacerbates the issue. What the smart home could become 
            is bring this arms race into the home, and that thought greatly disturbs me. Every last thing you do in your house would become some sort of 
            commercial interaction.
