        <h2 class="mt-10 text-black text-xl">Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">This is a continuation of project 1, the natural system of the solar system and space mining. I'll
            reiterate what I said about that project: Space is fascinating. Itâ€™s a vast expanse of infinite positibility. Space mining is simply
            a faucet of mankind's future. I wanted to expess that in a simple arcade game, and perhaps in a few years, decades, or centuries, 
            someone will control mining probes and collect resources from the stars as easily as they do in this simple game.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did you envision your controller in the beginning and how did that vision change?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">My original intentions was to simply remap the controls from a mouse and keyboard to a button and joystick
            or, perhaps, a pair of potentiometers. While that vision has largely remained the same, the final system mechanisms did change to 
            introduce challenge and chance into an otherwise straightforward simulation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did the physical peculiarities of the sensors influence your interaction?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">It really was quite simple. The joystick is a natural fit for two-dimensional movement and it was easy
            to make the transition from mouse controls to the new affordance. The button was a bit more complicated. The previous system necessitated
            the use of several keys, but for an arcade control scheme the simpler the better. Therefore, I had to reduce the amount of buttons down
            to one if any at all. The current targeting mechanic is a direct result of reducing down the necessary inputs.
        </p>  

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did the communication schema influence your interaction?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">While I originally had only basic markings to provide subtle suggestions to how the control mapping worked, 
            ultimately, there's only two methods of input. After some user testing, I found that introducing some illustrations on the controller helped 
            people immerse themselves into the game, but there was never any confusion regarding the controls.
        </p> 

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did you settle on the physical shape of your controllers?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">While I did play around with the idea of a handheld controller, ultimately I thought that this system 
            would make the most sense on an arcade control panel. That, and a tighter controller wouldn't have been able to accomodate the M-F wires
            that connected the input hardware to the breadboard. There certainly is room for streamlining it, but it'd be difficult in the breadboards
            current configuration.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> What would be some paths for future development of the project?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">There are some performance issues in the current build that I'd like to sort out, in addition to various
            improvements to graphics, and increasing the build quality of the controller.
