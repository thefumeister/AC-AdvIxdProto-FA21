        <h2 class="mt-10 text-black text-xl">Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Space is fascinating to me, it’s a vast expanse of uncharted territory that humans 
            have only ever scouted with telescopes and unmanned machines. It’s a frontier of infinite potential and 
            I truly do believe that the future of our civilization lies there. Space mining is simply a faucet of that future, 
            and it comes without all of the conflict and strings of mining here on Earth.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">Initially the system plan I had encompassed the Earth, sun, and asteroids wherein 
            Earth would construct mining teams using energy from the sun and minerals from asteroids before sending them out 
            on resource retrieval missions for the ultimate goal of developing Earth. However, the sun is a passive energy source 
            in real life and doesn't really need to be modeled in the system. In the end, the system was streamlined into probes, 
            asteroids, and the Earth: a collector, objects to be collected, and the deposit location.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl">How did you translate your diagram into code?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">The diagram was thought in terms of code to begin with, which made the transition 
            relatively straightforward to understand. It helped inform what code elements needed to be implemented, how they 
            needed to be implemented, and the necessary interactions between them.</p>  

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did you deal with the complexity in your system?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">In addition to the Processing References archive, I browsed different forums such as 
            Stackoverflow for troubleshooting errors and looking for solutions. In truth, the system isn’t terribly complicated.</p> 

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> How did you decide on the interactive elements?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">The interactive elements were chosen based on how I thought a real space mining mission 
            would go: mission control would look for rich asteroids, send a probe for collection, mine, recall it for retrieval, repeat. 
            Translate that to code, and the only real interactable item would be the probe.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 text-black text-xl"> What would be some paths for future development of the project?</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-black text-lg">In addition to an aesthetic overhaul with vector drawings or images, I want to expand the scope
             to include a full model of the solar system and add more complexity to mineral collection beyond an arbitrary score metric. 
            Asteroids should contain different kinds of minerals which can be used for construction of human space installations, perhaps.</p>
